* Project Symmetry

** What?
An attempt to convert all previous code written in Project Abstraction(written in C++) to C 
while using as few libraries as possible.

** Why?
- To create a platform on which i will base further projects on.
- To learn and remove as many black boxes as possible.
- Profit!?!
